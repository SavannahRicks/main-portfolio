<!-- Okay, so you're trying to use objectDesc! That's a good choice, and yes, it's 
   tricky to sort out how to work with it. It belongs in the teiHeader portion of 
   the document, and the hard part is figuring out *where*. So, objectDesc goes 
   inside a physDesc, and *that* goes inside an msDesc (for manuscript description).
   Here's an example: 
   https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/2.2.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/examples-objectDesc.html 
   The msDesc itself has a special place in the teiHeader! It goes inside the 
   sourceDesc element, and *that* sits inside the fileDesc that you can see in 
   oXygen. So...let's sort this out: 
   <teiHeader> <fileDesc> .... <sourceDesc> <msDesc> ... <objectDesc>.... 
   (I didn't put in the end tags, but I hope the indentation holds so you 
   can see how those are nested.) The TEI Header has lots of rules to try to sort out
   ...let's try this encoding out in class today and see if we can get the objectDesc working.

NOTE: I would probably not recommend the <p> element for the lines of Molly's snowshoes poem...

Savannah: I'm revisiting your code this morning to prepare our TEI schema exercise, 
and noticed the error on your div2 element. The problem is that when you use numbered
div elements, <div1> and <div2>, TEI expects <div2> to be *nested inside* <div1>. 
You're using them to number a sequence side-by-side. For that, I'd recommend just 
<div n="1> and <div n="2"> which wouldn't designate a *level* in the structure of the document.
