# DIGIT 110 RELAX NG TEST INSTRUCTIONS:  
# * Save these test files according to our standard file naming conventions for Canvas submissions.
# * Make the schema well-formed and document with  # comments where you made change(s). 
# * Then, associate the schema with the XML file we have provided for the exam.
# * Next, correct the schema code so that it validates the XML (happy green oXygen for both documents) and document briefly with # comments what you changed and why.
#  **NOTE**: DO NOT CHANGE the markup in the XML file, except to add your schema line!
#
# SUBMITTING YOUR EXAM:
# When you are finished, upload BOTH the schema and the XML file to Canvas using the posted upload point for this exam. 
# You may zip the files to submit them just as you have done for homework assignments.

start = xml
xml = element xml {metadata, recipe}
metadata = element metadata {title, author, editor, source, time, yield}#7: yield element was not here at all
title = element title {text}#1: text was misspelled
author = element author {id, text}
editor = element editor {id, text}
source = element source {url, text}#6: did not include url
time = element time {dur, text}
yield = element yield {text}
id = attribute id {xsd:ID}#4: attribute id used to be 'is'
url = attribute url {xsd:anyURI}
dur = attribute dur {xsd:duration}

recipe = element recipe {ingList, prep}
ingList = element ingList {heading, ing+}
heading = element heading {text}
ing = element ing {id, meas?, unit?, mixed{alt*}}
alt = element alt {meas, unit, text}
meas = attribute meas {xsd:float}
unit = attribute unit {"cup" | "T" | "t"  | "F" | "C" | "inch" | "pint"}#5: pint was not included

prep = element prep {heading, step+}#8: step was using a ? instead of a +
step = element step {n, mixed{(combine | equip | equipUse | ingUse)*}}#10: surrounded elements in parenthases to be less stricted in the order of what elements might show up first
equip = element equip {id, mixed{(equip | equipUse | setting | time | temp | size)*}}#9: temp element was not included #12: added size to list of elements #14: added * to mixed because there can be more than one element in equip
temp = element temp {meas, unit, text}
size = element size {depth, unit, text}
depth = attribute depth {xsd:float}
equipUse = element equipUse {ref, mixed{(temp | size | equip | equipUse | ingUse | setting | time)*}}
setting = element setting {text}#2: setting element was not defined
ingUse = element ingUse {ref, meas?, unit?, text}#11: gave meas and unit ?
ref = attribute ref {xsd:IDREFS}
combine = element combine {ref, mixed{ingUse}, text}#13: added mixed{ingUse} because it can show up anywhere in combine
n = attribute n {xsd:integer}#3: changed to xsd:integer
