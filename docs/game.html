            <p>Vanish is a game that I thought I would be interested in. Before I even downloaded I
                had the impression that this would be a horror game where people mysteriously
                "vanish." And even the webpage was eerie and dark. But when I opened the game
                I was met with color and of an NPC telling me about a "Game" starting. I was
                slightly disappointed that the horror impression was gone but I kept playing. The
                storyline was okay. I wasn't really interested in the story much and I can guess the
                ending not even halfway through the game. I was mainly interested in exploring all
                the nooks and crevasses because there were some funny dialogues. </p>
            <img class="photo" src="photos/prison.png" alt="Skull and bones photo"/>
                <p>The game isn't finished so I don't know the true ending, but basically you
                are a guy who just wakes up onto a cot, not knowing who you are and where you are by
                a person who is called #11. #11 wakes you up saying that the next Game is about to
                start. They explain that if you don't play the Game then you have forfeited and
                therefore will "Vanish." So, you play the game without dying (aka Vanishing), and
                gain 1 point. You find out to get out of this prison, you must gain at
                least 5 points, but that's without your memories. But if you were to gain 10
                points, then you can leave with all your memories.</p>
                <img src="photos/room.png" alt="photo of NPC's in a bedroom"/>
                <p>The characters were alright, there were some loose ends to what happened to some of
                them but they were alright. You can tell that #11 was creepy and that he
                might be behind something. #3 was straightforward and just wanted to get out of
                there, and the Announcer didn't have much to say to me. The only thing the Waiter
                had to say was that I was smart for choosing the Blue Pill.</p>
                <img src="photos/room%202.png" alt=" the game room photo"/>
                <p>Now, I have some criticisms, there will be some locked rooms and when interacted
                with, the dialogue would tell me that we must find a way in there, but then later
                in the story, the same door was magically opened for me. There wasn't any puzzle for
                me to solve, and it would be like that for another locked door. There was also a
                note I found after completing a game that has missing letters and numbers underneath
                the empty spaces, so I assumed that there would be a secret code I had to solve. But
                there was nothing else in the game that gave me any of the missing code. And the
                last thing is there is a "Room of Fate" where you can exchange your points for
                freedom, well you can also exchange points for unlocking a laptop in the Lobby, I
                did that in one of my save files and, to be honest, I was quite disappointed. I was
                just given some vague test results and vague information of an NPC I haven't even met
                yet. It was bare and useless when trying to uncover the big mystery of this
                Prison. Overall, the game is simple, and you can't unlock anything until you
                progress into the story more. The game was alright but there is some room
                for improvement.</p>
