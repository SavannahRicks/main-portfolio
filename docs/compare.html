            <h3>Text Analysis</h3>
            <p> For this homework, I didn't know where to start finding texts for comparison. So, I
                just started opening documents in the intro to DH folder an came across a file named
                flowersarenot.txt. It was eye-catching because it had a sad energy to it when I
                opened AntConc to 1 gram. It also had 'Tommy' at the top of the list. I also went
                ahead and tried finding a similar text with the same vibes called doorway.txt. Both
                texts are decent in size, Flowers has 9070 words and Doorway has 3641 words. At 2
                grams in Flowers, I get so many references of someone named Edward. Doorway has Mrs.
                Brown at the top, and the words 'don't, can't, won't, and he's' are not far behind.
                In KWIC the context for 'don't' shows a lot of arguments with Tommy’s parents, and
                how Tommy is always misbehaving. At the top of 4 grams, is 'couldn't love him.' The
                context of that phrase showed the title which was "Tommy... Whose Mother Couldn't
                Love Him." <br />Of course, I am in complete anguish discovering this. I then
                switched over to Flowers to 3 grams. The vibe is now hurried and worried. The phrase
                'give it up' was at the top. KWIC showed that as a kid, Edward liked getting into
                mischief and liked picking flowers from his mother’s garden, and how only his mother
                and his nanny react is how flowers are not made for picking, and to 'give it up.'
                'Give it up Edward' is the top of 4 grams. KWIC said the context for it shows that
                Edward doesn’t want to give up the flowers he's picked, even though everyone says
                his mother would be angry. It seems that in both texts, the main characters of each
                story have mothers who were either very cruel or unloving. It's very upsetting but
                one thing that I've found is that both texts have the word 'don't' near the top of 2
                grams, which really shows what kind of childhood these characters had, shown in
                Flowers Doc 2. It's sad but it's interesting. </p>
