            <h3>Text Analysis</h3>
            <p>For my Text Analysis, I found two texts labled as doorway.txt, and flowersarenot.txt.
                While looking for texts to do my comparison, I would browse through the radioplays
                we have in the introDH folder when I found the Doorway document. I looked at the
                document in 1 N-Gram and it just gave me this sad vibe. I saved it and later found
                the Flowers document, and it gave me the same feeling too, it will be the second
                text in my comparison. As shown below, there are two pictures (Doorway 1, Flowers
                1). It is each of the documents being ran through AntConc at 1 N-Gram. Already off
                the bat, Flowers has a larger word count at 6550, and Doorway has 4408 words. The
                pictures show that there isn't much going on in 1 N-Gram, except 'Tommy' in Doorway
                and 'Edward' in Flowers are placed second.</p>
            <div class="clearfix">
                <figure class="img-container">
                    <img src="photos/door1ngram.png" alt="1 N-Gram of Doorway" />
                    <figcaption>Doorway 1</figcaption>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>In the pictures Doorway and Flowers 2, shows each document in 2 N-Gram. Now we get a
                hint to what the tone of each story is. In both documents, the word 'don't' is
                listed at second most used. Specifically, Doorway 2 has 'i don' placed third,
                assuming it's someone responding defencivly to the opposer. In Flowers, I get the
                impression that Edward is being refused a lot in some way.</p>
            <div class="clearfix">
                <figure class="img-container">
                    <img src="photos/door2ngram.png" alt="2 N-Gram of Doorway" />

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Here in the third set of images, it shows each doc in 3 N-Gram. Since we have it set
                to Minimum 10 hits, we have significatly smaller list. I notice imediantly that even
                though Doorway is shorter in total word count, it has twice as many different N-Gram
                types. Tokens are pretty similar between docs though. Given that maybe Hits are
                distributed more in the types on Doorway. </p>
            <div class="clearfix">
                <figure class="img-container">
                    <img src="photos/door3ngram.png" alt="3 N-Gram of Doorway" />
                    <figcaption>Doorway 3</figcaption>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>I do some investigating in these next two images. In Doorway, I open KWIC for the 2
                N-Gram phrase 'don't.' The context to the word is a lot of heated arguements. It
                looks like it's a married couple is arguing over their son Tommy, and how they don't
                seem to care for him at all. The mother at one point tries to give Tommy away.</p>
            <p>Over in Flowers image, I bring up the context of the 3 N-Gram phrase 'give it up.' In
                here, I see that Edward is also a child whos mother act just as cruel as the one in
                Doorway. Edward acts a little mischivious but when he goes to pick a flower, his
                mother would get angry. It also suggests that Edward gets bullied by another kid and
                keeps getting his stuff stolen. It seemed that in both stories, both kids grew up
                with a lack of love from their parents. </p>

            </div>
            <p>Of course, I'm in absolute anguish while reading all of this. With all the negative
                language towards the characters in each story, no wonder I got such a sad vibe from
                both texts.</p>

            <h3>Text Analysis</h3>
            <p> For this homework, I didn't know where to start finding texts for comparison. So, I
                just started opening documents in the intro to DH folder an came across a file named
                flowersarenot.txt. It was eye-catching because it had a sad energy to it when I
                opened AntConc to 1 gram. It also had 'Tommy' at the top of the list. I also went
                ahead and tried finding a similar text with the same vibes called doorway.txt. Both
                texts are decent in size, Flowers has 9070 words and Doorway has 3641 words. At 2
                grams in Flowers, I get so many references of someone named Edward. Doorway has Mrs.
                Brown at the top, and the words 'don't, can't, won't, and he's' are not far behind.
                In KWIC the context for 'don't' shows a lot of arguments with Tommy’s parents, and
                how Tommy is always misbehaving (in Figure Doorway Doc). At the top of 4 grams, is 'couldn't love him.' The
                context of that phrase showed the title which was "Tommy... Whose Mother Couldn't
                Love Him." Of course, I am in complete anguish at this point. </p>
            
            <p>I then switched over to Flowers to 3 grams. The vibe is now hurried and worried. The
                phrase 'give it up' was at the top. KWIC showed that as a kid, Edward liked getting
                into mischief and liked picking flowers from his mother’s garden, and how only his
                mother and his nanny react is how flowers are not made for picking, and to 'give it
                up.' 'Give it up Edward' is the top of 4 grams. KWIC said the context for it shows
                that Edward doesn’t want to give up the flowers he's picked, even though everyone
                says his mother would be angry (in Figure Flowers Doc 2). It seems that in both texts, the main characters of
                each story have mothers who were either very cruel or unloving. It's very upsetting
                but one thing that I've found is that both texts have the word 'don't' near the top
                of 2 grams, which really shows what kind of childhood these characters had, shown in
                Flowers Doc 2. It's sad but it's interesting. </p>
