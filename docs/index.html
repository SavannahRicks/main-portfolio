      <h3>The Day I Found Out I was a Penn Stater!</h3>
      <h4>Posted on September 19, 2022</h4>
      <p> Well actually, I should say ‘the week’ I became a Penn Stater. I got my acceptence letter
        at the same time I recived a couple others in the mail. I was so suprised and so happy that
        these colleges wanted me at their schools. I didn’t want to make any quick desicions yet
        since it was rather a big one. I took about a week of contimplating and debating to finally
        decide on Penn State.</p>
