          <h1>First Website</h1>
            <p>A link to my personal <a href="https://github.com/SavannahRicks">Github Profile</a> heheheheh</p>
        <p>What is an <dfn>absolute URL? ></dfn>
            <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/">Penn State Erie, The Behrend College</a>. Here is another link for an <dfn>absolute URL</dfn> that 
            takes you to the "code view" of the introDH-Hub GitHub repository. Can you change
            this to point to the code view of your own GitHub repository? I think so? My <a href="https://github.com/SavannahRicks/main-portfolio/commit/6a701244e69861e2626024206d08baa96e3bbde4">first commit</a> to an HTML file in Github.</p>
        <p>But here is a link to another page inside my website: this is a <dfn>relative URL</dfn>:
                <a href="innerPage.html">inner page on this website</a><!-- the link doesn't take me anywhere -->.</p>
        <p>Do absolute links take you outside of the website, and relative links take you somewhere else in the same website?</p>
        <p>Not gonna lie, I love HTML. I've already learned some of this in High School which is why I knew I liked coding :)</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

            <!-- ebb: You can make a <section> or a <div> element just to organize different parts of the page.
      The <section> element should always have a heading element inside <h1>, <h2>, etc. to identify what's here.
      -->
            <h2>Lists: <dfn>ordered</dfn> and <dfn>unordered</dfn> </h2>
            <p>The heading above is smaller than the first one on this page, because I selected an <code>h2</code> element for a second-level heading.</p>
            <!-- ebb: Look up what a <dfn> element is for: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dfn.asp -->
            <!--ebb: You can write CSS code to change the *way* this is ordered, from numbers to letters or symbols, for example. -->
            <ol><!-- ordered -->
                <li>dawn</li>
                <li>afternoon</li>
                <li>evening</li>
                <li>midnight</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>A <strong>third-level</strong> heading just to see what that looks like</h3>
            <p>HTML code has <em>lower-level</em> headings like from h2 to h6, but use them in order
                as you create subsections! You can control the size, position, color, font, and more
                of headings (and any HTML display elements) using CSS.</p>
            <p>When should I use <b>bold</b> vs. <strong>strong</strong> in HTML code? These are
                    <dfn>inline</dfn> elements.</p>
            <p> Other HTML elements like the <dfn>p</dfn> (for paragraph) or the heading level
                elements, or ordered and unorderd lists, or img elements make blocks on the page and
                are known as <dfn>block</dfn> elements.</p>

            <h2>Introducing images</h2>
            <p>Images can be tricky to format. First let's just include them on the website. In your code, you point to an image file in your file directory
                to make it appear on the page when it is published.</p>
            <p>The <code>img</code> element is the basic code for including an image file on your page. The <code>@src</code> attribute points to a filepath
                to your image. The <code>@alt</code> attribute provides a text description for screen readers, helping your images to be accessible to non-sighted readers
                and also to assist with search retrievals (say, google searches) by providing some context of what's in the image. 
                Writing code on a site to assist with search retrieval is called <dfn>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</dfn>.
            </p>
            <p>Other code is here for styling and blocking on the page. A <code>figure</code> element is intended to help organize images and captions in a 
            little nested structure, that makes it convenient to style for proportion on the page. I am also adding a <code>@class</code> attribute to help
            me with styling different kinds of images (photos vs. small icons on my site). I write <a href="style.css">CSS code</a> to find elements with a <code>class="photo"</code>
            and style them all the same way, and I put that code in a separate file so it can handle styling the same way across all the pages on my
            website. I link that CSS stylesheet to my HTML files up in the <code>head</code> element. <em>Can you find the CSS <code>link</code> line in this file?</em></p>
