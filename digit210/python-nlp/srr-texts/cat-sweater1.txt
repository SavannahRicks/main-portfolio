crochet pattern for a sweater for a cat

Here is a simple crochet pattern for a sweater for a cat:

Materials:

Worsted weight yarn in a color of your choice
Crochet hook in a size appropriate for the yarn (check the label on the yarn for a recommended hook size)
Yarn needle
Abbreviations:

ch = chain
sc = single crochet
sl st = slip stitch
st = stitch
Instructions:

Chain 20.
Row 1: Sc in second chain from hook and in each chain across, turn. (19 sc)
Row 2: Ch 1, sc in each st across, turn.
Repeat Row 2 until the piece measures 8 inches in length.
Fold the piece in half lengthwise, with the right sides facing each other.
Join the two sides together by working single crochets through both layers, as follows: Insert your hook through both layers, yarn over, and pull up a loop. Yarn over and pull through both loops on the hook. Repeat this process until you have joined the two sides together.
Cut the yarn and weave in the ends with a yarn needle.
To put the sweater on your cat, slip it over their head and adjust the fit as necessary. You may want to add a button or other closure to keep the sweater in place.

I hope this pattern is helpful and your cat enjoys their new sweater!
