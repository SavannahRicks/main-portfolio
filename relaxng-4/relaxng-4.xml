<!-- 👍 The link works! I am admiring how you have organized your GitHub repo to handle both DIGIT 100 and 110. :-)

👏 Brilliant work on the gingersnaps schema, Savannah! I'm impressed that you worked out how to create a pattern, 
so you don't have to repeat a complicated structure over and over: I like your 
bPattern very much. I notice you didn't try xsd:ID and xsd:IDREFS here, but if 
you want to try applying them: you try making your @name attribute be the xsd:ID 
datatype: it would just make that name value be a distinct identifier to help mark
the moment when you provide lots of detail about it. Then, if you add more markup 
down in the steps (I know, you already have lots of markup so this is just for fun
now): you could provide another element with an attribute to hold *mentions* of 
each specific ingredient, and that datatype for the attribute would be xsd:IDREF 
or xsd:IDREFS if you want to mention multiple of them at once: like <ingredUse 
ref="cin gin clov">spices</ingredUse>.

    <desc>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in
        tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday season.
        But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a
        comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</desc>
