            the

         . This set in motion a chain of events that would bring down an empire and change
         forever the relationship between man and the gods.

         <span class="location">White Gold Tower</span>

         reminded
         him
         of a childhood friend. Others say it was a
         <span class="event">moment of prophecy</span>
         . Whatever the case, the
         prisoner
         came to play a fateful role in the history of the
         <span class="location">Empire</span>
         and
         <span class="location">Tamriel</span>
         - surely a sign that the gods themselves were at work.

         </p>
      
      <p>
         The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of

         known as the
         <span class="faction">Mythic Dawn</span>
         . (Those who still suspect the
         <span class="faction">Dark Brotherhood</span>
         should consider two facts: first, they would have only needed a single assassin, not
         a small army of them; second, the
         <span class="faction">Dark Brotherhood</span>
         would never be so foolish as to
         <span class="event">effectively declare war on the Empire</span>

         . Uncrowned,
         Martin
         joined the battle in the
         <span class="location">city streets</span>

            Mehrunes Dagon himself
            left
            <span class="location">Oblivion</span>
            and entered
            <span class="location">Tamriel</span>
            </span>
         , breaking the covenant. Only the unlit Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now
         that the barrier was ripped asunder, it was too late to relighting the Fires.
         Martin Septim
         chose to make the ultimate sacrifice -
         <span class="event">
            he
            shattered the
            <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span>
            to become the
            avatar of the god Akatosh
            and do battle with
            Mehrunes Dagon
            </span>

         Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
         <span class="event">
            Mehrunes Dagon
            was defeated and sent back to
            <span class="location">Oblivion</span>
            </span>
         .
         <span class="event">
            The
            avatar of Akatosh
            was turned to stone
            </span>
         and can be seen to this day in the
         <span class="location">Temple of the One</span>
         in the
         <span class="location">Imperial City</span>
         . With the
         <span class="item">Amulet</span>
         gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier
         to
         <span class="location">Oblivion</span>
         is sealed forever.
