         <p><l>Dear <rs type="person">Mrs. Behrend:</rs></l>
            <l>In reference to your recent letters, I offer he following comments--</l></p>
         <p n="1"><l>We would be most pleased to have <rs type="person">Mr. Paul Laver</rs> from the
               Cemetery do certain </l>
            <l>planting around the entrance to the <rs type="plac">Behrend Center</rs> campus. We
               understand </l>
            <l>that this planting will be done by utilising the existing shrubbery in the </l>
            <l>formal gardens. It is also my understanding that you will remimburse <name>Mr
                  Laven</name>
            </l>
            <l>for his labors only for the planting around the enterance and for no other plant<pc
                  force="inter">-</pc></l>
            <l>ing. If you have not not already done so, I would suggest that you contact <rs
                  type="person">Mr. Day</rs></l>
            <l>informing him of your desires to have <name>Mr. Laver</name> do the above mentioned
               work.</l></p>
         <p n="2"><l>Insofar as the new building is concerned, we do not plan ot proceed with
               this</l>
            <l>project this year. We have not as yet heard from <rs type="org">General Electric</rs>
               as to their </l>
            <l>intention of us doing their training program this fall. It will be impossible at </l>
            <l>this late date to complete any building arrangemants for the Fall term, con<pc
                  force="inter">-</pc></l>
            <l>sequently we have delayed any action on a new building of this present year. </l>
            <l>We, however, plan to spend approximatly $25,000.00 completing the other </l>
            <l>half of the barn for utilization as classrooms.</l></p>
         <p n="3"><l>We have located some of the lights for the living room which are in need of
               repair.</l>
            <l>At the present time we will investigate the repair of these lights and I will re<pc
                  force="inter">-</pc></l>
            <l>port to you at a later date as to whether or not they can be effectively
               repaired.</l>
         </p>
         <p n="4"><l>We are making arrangements to erect a wrought iron rail around the case in
               which</l>
            <l>the <name type="place">Niagara</name> is desplayed. Quite a few people have commented
               about the ship and </l>
            <l>have visited us with the express purpose of viewing it.</l></p>
         <p n="5"><l>Under separate cover we are sending you the television films of the
               presentation</l>
            <l>of the Flagship. These films can be shown on a standard <measure>16mm</measure>.
               projector.</l>
         </p>
         <p n="6"><l>In reference to the heating of the swimming pool, I have talked on two
               different</l>
            <l>occasions with <name type="person">Mr. Scobell</name> about completing the project.
               As yet he has done </l>
            <l>nothing to heat the pool with the exception of having ordered a piece of equip<pc
                  force="inter">-</pc></l>
            <l>ment that is needed to put the furnace in the immediate future to complete
            it.</l></p>
         <p n="7"><l>In reference to the scholarships, as a result of our last <orgName>Advisory
                  Board</orgName> meeting,</l>
            <l>Mr. Nick appointed a new <orgName>Scholarship Committee</orgName>, consisting of <rs
                  type="person">Jerry Stokes</rs>, Chair-</l>
            <l>man, <rs type="person">William Hamilton </rs>and <rs type="person">John Zern</rs>. I
               have had one meeting with <name>Mr. Stokes </name>and </l>
            <l>we are planning to arrange for a number of scholarships which will be available </l>
            <l>by <date>September 1956</date>. Our scholarship fund at present has been consumed so
               that </l>
            <l>there is only $650.00 remaining in this fund. We have given one scholarship </l>
            <l>to a <name type="place">McDowell High School </name>student for <date>September
                  1955</date>. The scholarship fund </l>
            <l>has not been generally advertised this year because of the small amount of </l>
            <l>money available. We have not in the past had scholarships that were specifically </l>
            <l>designated as <orgName>Protestant scholarships</orgName>. Inasmuch as we are a state
               university</l>
            <l>we do not feel that it would be ethical to differentiate as to religion or </l>
            <l>race in the issuance of a scholarship. I will keep you informed of the activities </l>
            <l>of this committee and what prograss they make. I am quite sure that we will be</l>
            <l>building the scholarship fund to the point where at least one scholarship will</l>
            <l>be available to all eleven of the area high schools each year. Generally speak-</l>
            <l>ing scholarships are in the amount of $100.00 per year, per student.</l></p>
         <p n="8"><l><rs type="person">Ross P. Wright </rs>of <orgName>Reed Mfg. Company
               </orgName>has sent several copies of letters that</l>
            <l>were supposedly written by <rs type="person">Commodore Perry </rs>on the deck of the
                  <name type="place">Ship Niagara </name>on </l>
            <l>the afternoon of his victory. We plan to have these copies framed and placed </l>
            <l>in <name type="place">Erie Hall </name>along with the Flagship.</l></p>
         <p n="9"><l>I hope this letter finds you in good health and enjoying the summer. Please</l>
            <l>give my kindest regards to <rs type="person">Gail</rs>. Our family is well and in
               good health.</l>

            P.S. Thanks very much for the London Illustrated News. We will put these
