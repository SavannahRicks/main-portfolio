    <intro><where>On Board <ship>La Touraine</ship></where>, <date>June 30th, 1917.</date></intro>
    <para>Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am actually off to
            <country>France</country> and, for the first time in my life, traveling alone.
        Everything has happened so quickly since the <organization>American Fund for French
            Wounded</organization> found an opening for me in <city>Paris</city> that I suppose I am
        still somewhat <feeling n="1">dazed</feeling> and <feeling n="2">bewildered</feeling>. The
        fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look ahead makes it easier
        to be <feeling n="3">happy</feeling> and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of
        a <adjective>taste </adjective>in <city>New York </city> of the work that the
            <organization>A. F. F. W.</organization> is doing but its <place>Headquarters in
                <!-- im not sure where these two errors are coming from -->
                <city>Paris </city></place>will be different in some ways I fancy.</para>
    <para><feeling n="4"> I can't get over how lucky </feeling> I am to have this chance for realize
        how few girls of my age are getting across, and I <feeling n="5">understood </feeling>the
        grit and pluck which made you <feeling n="6">encourage </feeling>me on my great adventure
        and send me along a path which has proved so <adjective>dangerous </adjective>of
        late.</para>
    <para>As we <adjective>drifted </adjective>down the river, in the sunset <adjective>glow
        </adjective>with two <adjective>absurd </adjective>tugs <adjective>puffing
        </adjective>alongside, I <feeling n="7">know that many eyes were <adjective>moist
            </adjective></feeling>and that the same thought was in all our minds. How many of this
        ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very <adjective>quiet</adjective>, no
        one spoke much, and, little by little, the <adjective>glow </adjective>faded from the sky
        and one star after another appeared. I knew that you would be looking at those same stars
        down in <city>Lakewood</city> and that your <feeling n="8">thoughts and prayers were the
            same that filled my heart </feeling>at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate,
        after all.</para>
    <para>We waited near the <place>Statue of Liberty</place> until midnight—a rumor had it that a
        "personage" was to come on board. This individual was <adjective>shrouded </adjective>in
        mystery until we put to sea when it was given out that the party which had
            <adjective>clambered </adjective>aboard in the night was none other than the Italian
        Mission. Our spirits <adjective>rose </adjective>at once for, what with Frank Sayre on the
        boat and these <adjective>distinguished </adjective>Italian gentlemen, we shall <feeling
            n="9">doubtless </feeling>be <feeling n="10">honored </feeling>by a bigger convoy and so
        doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two destroyers following us. They can be seen
            <adjective>distinctly outlined </adjective> against the horizon, one on each side, and
        seem to be the same <adjective>somber gray </adjective>which all ships are affecting in this
        war. A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or
        five days but that after that I might see some <feeling n="11">excitement</feeling>. Here's
            <feeling n="12">hoping</feeling>!</para>
    <para>I have a small inside cabin and my room-mate is quite a character. She is a native of
        Haiti, <adjective>voluble and very portly</adjective>—has four large pieces of baggage in
        our <adjective>tiny </adjective>stateroom, wears a costume which resembles a Mother Hubbard
        and smokes countless thin cigarettes that <adjective>smell </adjective>like incense! When I
        appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, luckily I am
            <adjective>small</adjective>, and I was soon <adjective>tucked </adjective>into the
        upper berth with my belongings! She really <adjective>isn't bad </adjective>and after
        looking me over <adjective>carefully </adjective>told me that she didn't think we would
        fight and from that time has <adjective>beamed </adjective>upon me! She is going over to
        join her son who has been fighting with the French since the beginning of the war but will
        never go back to the Front now, having lost some fingers off each hand. She is so <feeling
            n="13">thankful</feeling>, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers.</para>
